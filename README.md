# Installation and Usage
To use the application, download repository and install JavaFX. After installation, launch the application and follow the instructions to create a new user or login to an existing account. Then move futher and start logging your meals and tracking your daily food intake.

# Windows
The application includes four seperate windows: Create New User Window, Login User, Main , and Statistics.

## Create New User Window
The Create New User Window allows users to enter their information to create an account. Users must provide their name, age, sex, weight, height, workout frequency, and their goal (to maintain, lose, or gain weight). All of the above informations are nedded to calculate their daily caloric needs, fats, carbs, and proteins.

## Login User Window
The Login Window allows existing users to log in to their accounts using their username.

## Main Panel Window
The Main Window is the primary window of the application, where users can log their meals and track their daily food intake. The window is divided into several sections: 

* Top section where user can track their daily caloric, fat, carb, and protein intake and progress towards their goals.

* Search bar where user can search thru the database for specific food items. The search bar is designed to be flexible, so the user can enter just part of the name of the food item and still find it.

* Main section including: 
- List of all products from the database.
- Edit section where the user can modify product data in the database as well as specify the size of the portion they consumed, that can be done in a flexible way. Instead of just specifying the exact weight of the portion in grams, the user can indicate a fraction of the default package size.
- List of food items that the user has eaten in a day. The list shows the time that the food item was consumed, and it updates dynamically as the user adds more food items to their daily intake.

## Statistics Window
The Statistics Window provides users with information on their daily, weekly, and monthly food intake. Users can view their progress over time and make adjustments to their diet as necessary.
